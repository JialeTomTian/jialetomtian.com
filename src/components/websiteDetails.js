        Where to Eat is an web app that takes in a number of restaurant options each with a priority rating and randomly decides on a location. The program also features
        a backend database using Postgres which keeps track of all restaurants that people have visited in the nearby area. Through this project, I hope to be finally able to make a decision
        on food with my friends. :D

        (Postgres, Express, React, Node). I moved a main company revenue stream by planning, designing
        developing and testing a online gift card system from scratch. This process involved not
        only designing the frontend of the portal but also working on the backend to register gift cards with
        encryption to ensure security. The current physical gift card system has registered over 450000 transactions,
        and this new system aims to move all future transactions online. I also implemented a customer communication system
        through online emails and Facebook Customer chat SDK that is currently use by 19 branches across North America.
        The email portion involves working on the pre-exising company Node.js and Express server while the
        Facebook Customer Chat involves working with a third party API. Finally, I spent time upgrading the company
        website webcache and developer portal for VR game payments. During this process, I worked from home while
        effectively communicating with my supervisor.`
